# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Instructions for story-simulator

## Project Overview

story-simulator is an MCP server exposing a text-simulation game master's
tools (`start_world`, `perceive`, `update_registry`, ...). World state lives
in a Postgres-backed `iacs` registry, not in this project's own process
memory or in any YAML file — see `docs/architecture.md` for the full
picture.

## Reloading `story-simulator-mcp` after editing its code

`.mcp.json` spawns `story-simulator-mcp` once, as a long-lived stdio
subprocess, when this session's MCP connection is established. Python
doesn't hot-reload: editing `story_simulator/mcp_server.py` (or anything it
imports) has **no effect on an already-running session** until that
subprocess restarts — calling `mcp__story-simulator__*` tools after an edit
silently keeps exercising the pre-edit code.

**Fix, verified working (no session restart needed):**

```bash
pkill -f story-simulator-mcp
```

The harness auto-respawns it fresh on the very next `mcp__story-simulator__*`
tool call, picking up current source. World state is untouched (it lives in
Postgres, not this process), but the session-scoped registrar cache resets,
so call `start_world` again once after killing it.

Confirmed live: killed the subprocess, stopped Postgres, then called
`start_world` through the reloaded connection with no manual `service
postgresql start` — it self-healed via the (freshly loaded)
`_ensure_postgres_running()` fix, proving the kill actually picks up new
code rather than just timing out to the same behavior.

For validating plain Python logic changes (not the live MCP tool surface
itself), prefer `pytest`/a fresh `python -c` invocation over this — it's
lower-friction and always reads current disk state, same reasoning, less
ceremony.
